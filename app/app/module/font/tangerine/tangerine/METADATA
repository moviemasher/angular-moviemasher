description: <p>Tangerine is a calligraphy font inspired by many italic chancery hands from the 16-17th \
  century. Its tall ascender, the most distinct characteristic of this type, takes a wide line space \
  between lines and gives it a graceful texture. It is generally advisable to use Tangerine for a \
  title or short text at large size because of the short height of lowercase letters. Tangerine is \
  produced by Japanese type designer Toshi Omagari and was named after a woman who encouraged him \
  to begin this work.</p>
