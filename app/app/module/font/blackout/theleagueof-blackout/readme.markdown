Blackout
========
_by [Tyler Finck](http://www.sursly.com)_

Eats holes for breakfast lunch and dinner. Inspired by filling in sans-serif newspaper headlines. Continually updated with coffee and music. Makes your work louder than the next personâ€™s.

Comes in three styles: Midnight (solid), 2AM (reversed), & Sunrise (stroked).

    Notes from Tyler:
    
    I made this font in 2008 with Illustrator and Font Lab Studio, 
    both of which are wonderful. This is not based on any other 
    font and was created from scratch, although I'm sure there are 
    similarities to other fonts out there (purely coincidental).
